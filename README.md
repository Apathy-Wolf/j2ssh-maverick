J2SSH Maverick
==============

J2SSH Maverick is the successor to the original J2SSH API and includes a complete and stable implementation of an SSH2 client. Originally built from the ground up by the original author back in 2003, this product has, until now, only been available under a commercial license. With the development and pending release of a third generation SSH API, this legacy API has now been released under the LGPL v3 and will continue to be maintained by the core author as a contribution to the open source community.

Status
------

This code was branched from our commercial codebase on August 27th 2014 and converted to a maven project for easier distribution in the ether. The version has been changed to 1.5.0 to avoid conflicts with our commercial codebase which continues to be developed. Bug fixes from our private repository will be pushed to this branch periodically along with any other community contributions that are forthcoming.
