/**
 * 
 * <p>
 * Callback interface to display authentication banner messages.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * In some jurisdictions sending a warning message before authentication may be
 * relevant for getting legal protection. Many UNIX machines, for example,
 * normally display text from `/etc/issue', or use "tcp wrappers" or similar
 * software to display a banner before issuing a login prompt.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Implement this interface to show the authentication banner message. The
 * method should display the message and should not return until the user
 * accepts the message
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * To configure a banner display you must setup the <a
 * href="Ssh2Context">Ssh2Context</a> on a <a
 * href="../ssh/SshConnector">SshConnector</a> instance using the following
 * code: <blockquote>
 * 
 * <pre>
 * SshConnector con = SshConnector.getInstance();
 * 
 * BannerDisplay display = new BannerDisplay() {
 * 	public void displayBanner(String message) {
 * 		System.out.println(message);
 * 		System.in.read();
 * 	}
 * };
 * Ssh2Context context = (Ssh2Context) con.getContext(SshConnector.SSH2);
 * context.setBannerDisplay(display);
 * </pre>
 * 
 * </blockquote>
