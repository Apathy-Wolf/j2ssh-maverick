/**
 * <p>
 * Base interface for SSH sessions supporting all the features common to both
 * SSH1 and SSH2. Sessions are created through the <a
 * href="SshClient.html#openSessionChannel()">openSessionChannel()</a> method of
 * the <a href="SshClient.html">SshClient</a>. Once a session has been obtained
 * the session will not be active until you either call <a
 * href="#executeCommand(java.lang.String)">executeCommand(String command)<a> or
 * <a href="#startShell()">startShell()<a>. Once activated you can use the IO
 * streams to read and write to the remote process. The following code shows the
 * basic process: <blockquote>
 * 
 * <pre>
 * SshConnector con = SshConnector.getInstance();
 * SshClient ssh = con.connect(
 * 	new SocketTransport("beagle2.sshtools.net", 22),
 * 	"martianx");
 * 
 * PasswordAuthentication pwd = new PasswordAuthentication();
 * pwd.setPassword("likeidgivethataway!");
 * 
 * if(ssh.authenticate(pwd)==SshAuthentication.COMPLETE) {
 * 	SshSession sesison = ssh.openSessionChannel();
 * 
 *      if(session.requestPseudoTerminal("vt100",
 * 			80,
 * 			24,
 * 			 0,
 * 			 0)) {
 *           session.startShell();
 * 
 *           session.getOutputStream().write("ls\n".getBytes());
 *      }
 * } else {
 * 	System.out.println("Authentication failed");
 * }
 * 
 * 
 * SshSession objects can't maintain state so performing a "cd c:\\temp" command would have no effect instead the Shell class should be used.
 * 
 * </pre>
