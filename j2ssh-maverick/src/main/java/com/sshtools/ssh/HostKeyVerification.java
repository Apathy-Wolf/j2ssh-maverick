/**
 * <p>
 * This interface provides a callback method so that the user can verify the
 * identity of the server (by checking the public key) during the initial
 * protocol negotiation. This check is performed at the beginning of each
 * connection to prevent trojan horses (by routing or DNS spoofing) and
 * man-in-the-middle attacks.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The user should verify that the key is acceptable; the most usual method
 * being a local database file called <em>known_hosts</em>. The core J2SSH
 * Maverick engine does not enforce any specific host key verification in order
 * that the engine can be used on Java platforms that do not have File objects.
 * A <em>known_hosts</em> implementation <a
 * href="../../sshtools/publickey/AbstractKnownHostsKeyVerification.html"
 * >AbstractKnownHostsKeyVerification</a> can be found in the SSHTools utility
 * classes supplied with the J2SSH Maverick API. This also includes the basic <a
 * href="../../sshtools/publickey/ConsoleKnownHostsKeyVerification.html">
 * ConsoleKnownHostsKeyVerification</a> which performs the check by prompting
 * the user through stdin/stdout.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The public key instances supplied to the <a href=
 * "#verifyHost(java.lang.String, com.sshtools.ssh.components.SshPublicKey)">
 * verifyHost</a> method will be one of the following implementations:<br>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * To set a host key verification you must get an instance of the SshConnector
 * and configure the SSH version context's with your implementation.
 * <blockquote>
 * 
 * <pre>
 * SshConnector con = SshConnector.getInstance();
 * 
 * HostKeyVerification hkv = new HostKeyVerification() {
 * 	public boolean verifyHost(String name, SshPublicKey key) throws IOException {
 * 		// Verify the host somehow???
 * 		return true;
 * 	}
 * };
 * SshContext context = con.getContext();
 * context.setHostKeyVerification(hkv);
