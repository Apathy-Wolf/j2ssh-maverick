/**
 * 
 * <p>
 * Simple interface wrapper for transport layer communication. An SSH connection
 * requires a transport layer for communication and this interface defines the
 * general contract. Typically SSH will execute over a TCPIP Socket however the
 * use of this interface allows any type of transport that can expose a set of
 * I/O streams. In the simplest form this interface will be implemented for a
 * Socket as follows: <a name="SocketTransport"></a> <blockquote>
 * 
 * <pre>
 * import java.net.Socket;
 * import java.io.*;
 * 
 * public class SocketTransport extends Socket implements SshTransport {
 *   public SocketProvider(String host, int port) throws IOException {
 *     super(host, port);
 *   }
 *   public String getConnectedHost() {
 *      return getInetAddress().getHostName();
 *   }
 * 
 *   ** The close, getInputStream and getOutputStream methods are exposed **
 *   ** directly by the Socket.                                           **
 * </blockquote>
 * </pre>
 *
