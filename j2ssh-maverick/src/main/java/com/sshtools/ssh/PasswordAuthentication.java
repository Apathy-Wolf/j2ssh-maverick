/**
 * <p>
 * Basic password authentication class used for SSH password authentication.
 * Once a connection has been established to an SSH server the user is normally
 * required to authenticate themselves. This class implements a basic password
 * <a href="SshAuthentication.html">SshAuthentication</a> that can be passed
 * into the <a href="SshClient.html">SshClient</a> to authenticate. As a
 * username is required to establish a connection it is not required that it be
 * set on the password object, however if you wish to change the username you
 * can do so (this may not be allowed by some server implementations).
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Use password authentication as follows: <blockquote>
 * 
 * <pre>
 * SshConnector con = SshConnector.getInstance();
 * SshClient ssh = con.connect(new SocketTransport(&quot;beagle2.mars.net&quot;, 22),
 * 		&quot;martianx&quot;);
 * 
 * PasswordAuthentication pwd = new PasswordAuthentication();
 * pwd.setPassword(&quot;likeidgivethataway!&quot;);
 * 
 * if (!ssh.isAuthenticated()) {
 * 	if (ssh.authenticate(pwd) == SshAuthentication.COMPLETE) {
 * 		// Transfer some files or do something else interesting
 * 	}
 * }
 * </pre>
 * 
 * </blockquote>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * It is recommended that in situations where you may be connecting to an SSH2
 * server, that the <a
 * href="../ssh2/Ssh2PasswordAuthentication.html">Ssh2PasswordAuthentication</a>
 * subclass is used instead. This extends the basic functionality provided here
 * by supporting the changing of the users password.
 * </p>
